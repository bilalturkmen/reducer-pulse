## 👍 My Challenges:

To demonstrate how useReducer can be used as a powerful alternative to external state libraries while maintaining clean, scalable architecture in real-world scenarios.

- ⚙️ useReducer for predictable state transitions
- 🧠 useMemo for performance optimization
- 🌍 Context API for global state sharing
